# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The **Weather Dashboard** is a web application that allows users to search for current and future weather conditions for multiple cities. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to provide accurate and detailed weather data, including temperature, wind speed, and humidity. It features a sleek, responsive design, dynamically updated HTML and CSS, and persistent search history saved with localStorage.

This project demonstrates how to fetch and display data from a third-party API, manage user interactions, and store persistent data in the browser.

## Features

- **Dynamic Weather Data**: Displays city name, date, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather icons.
- **Search History**: Saves previously searched cities in localStorage and displays them for quick access.
- **Clean User Interface**: A modern, responsive design that works seamlessly across devices.
